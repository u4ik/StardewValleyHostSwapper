## Important Notes ⚠️
- This tool **only swaps the first farmhand** with the host.
- The swap will switch the `homeLocation` and `UniqueMultiplayerID`, so mailboxes should work correctly.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️
- **File not listed?** Ensure it is in the same directory as the executable.
- **Save file not swapping?** Check that the file contains a `<player>` section and a `<Farmer>` under `farmhands`.
- **Need to undo?** Always keep a backup of your save file before using this tool.

## Disclaimer ⚠️
This tool is provided **as-is** without any warranties. The developer is **not responsible** for corrupted save files. **Please create a backup** of your save file before using this application.

Happy farming! 🌾🐄
